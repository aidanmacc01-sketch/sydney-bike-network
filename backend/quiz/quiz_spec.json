          "correct_option_index": 1,
          "explanation": "The 'door zone' extends roughly 1–1.5 m from a parked car. Staying outside it gives you reaction time if a door opens unexpectedly. This is sometimes called riding the 'secondary position' in bike lanes next to parking."

          ],
          "correct_option_index": 1,
          "explanation": "Taking the primary lane position signals clearly to drivers that the lane is too narrow to share side-by-side. It prevents dangerous close-passes and keeps you visible. Move left again once a safe passing opportunity exists."

          "explanation": "Even when no speed limit is posted on a path, you must ride at a speed that allows you to stop or avoid a hazard at any moment. On a busy shared path, pedestrians can step sideways without warning — near-walking pace protects them and you."

          "explanation": "Physical damage can puncture internal cells and cause short circuits, even if no sparks or heat are visible immediately. A cracked or damaged battery can go into thermal runaway at any time — including during charging. Never charge or use a visibly damaged battery. Have it professionally assessed or safely disposed of."

          "explanation": "Swelling (puffing) in a lithium-ion battery means gas is being produced by internal chemical breakdown. A swollen battery can rupture or ignite at any time. Stop using it immediately, do not attempt to puncture or compress it, and take it to an authorised e-waste facility for safe disposal."

          "explanation": "Water ingress can corrode cell connections and create internal short circuits that are not immediately visible.

          "correct_option_index": 2,
          "explanation": "Lithium-ion batteries are safest and longest-lasting when stored partially charged (not full, not flat) at a moderate, stable temperature. Extreme heat accelerates degradation and increases fire risk. Never store connected to a charger. If storing in a shed or garage, consider removing the battery and keeping it indoors."
